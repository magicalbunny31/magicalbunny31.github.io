                           of his departure from the internet: below will be a brief summary of it (however, you should read his statement to truly understand his full story!)

                        <ul>
                           <li>it was intentional - something he had been planning to do for a while now</li>
                           <li>his content "hadn't been getting the attention it used to years ago" (and his discord server had been pretty much dead for a long time then)</li>
                           <li>a large portion of his enjoyment and passion for creating video had cooled off</li>
                           <li>not knowing whether a video was "good enough" was taking a toll on him for the worse</li>

                              was losing popularity
                           </li>
                           <li>as he took breaks, he enjoyed those periods of time being away from the internet and saw "how precious and enjoyable life truly is when your eyes aren't constantly glued to a computer screen"</li>
                           <li>looking back at the things he did on the internet, such as his youtube channel, made him cringe a lot; and, as a result, he removed his footprint online (at least related to the alias "gentleberry16 gerek")</li>

I may have joined the server late, but I will always remember gentleberry and the funny memories of watching those videos when I got home from school. Goodbye and have fun,

                                 I didn't know what happened until now, but it was a really fun ride while it lasted. It's understandable why this decision was made as I got tired of FE2 myself. I won't forget the long lasting impression and positivity the community had. Farewell, and stay safe. Good luck to everyone else that's still in the community (maintaining the FE2 community for this long must be one hell of a nightmare)

                                 Thanks for the memories, guys. Hope you do well in the future gentle! I literally grew up in this server and made countless friends - some of which I still talk with to this day, and I can't thank gentle enough for the opportunity to meet them. This server was always welcoming and a great place to chat with others, and even though I may have been slightly inappropriate at times, I still had some of the best times of my life in this server, no matter how sad that may sound. I wish for the best for all of you and especially gentle!! It was nice meeting you all ü•∫

                                 Time flies, when i first joined this server i was some weirdo who only sat in front of their computer and wasted hours not accomplishing anything. Now I spend my days hanging out with friends making great memories, actually being efficient with my time and I'd be lying if I said this server had no impact on any of that. I don't know how the server was before I joined although I did hear quite a lot of ogs say it was a really weird place but my experience with the community and the server has been quite honestly great and I couldn't have wished for a friendlier server. Without you guys I probably wouldn't have been the very mature (/j) and hilarious Doruk a lot of people now know me for. I love all of you and hope fate reunites us some day
                                 <br/>
                                 Now for some words for you Gentle, 
                                 <br/>
                                 Gentle, I got to meet you in 2020 after coming to the server like a day after you published your first jtoh video, I never thought id get to be one of your friends but I'm glad I was because you are one of the nicest, kindest people I've got to known. You have a very special place in my heart for how incredible and sweet of a person you are and I'll miss all of the delightful conversations we've ever had. I understand and respect your decisions, it's perfectly normal to move on, I've personally have moved on a lot of things you had known me for and some changed my life for the better. I hope the same goes for you. I wish you the very best and hope you have a wonderful life 
                                 <br/>

                                 They say Time flies when you're having fun and I wholeheartedly agree with that statement. When I first saw your videos I was some kid who loved Roblox and played it every day, and I used your videos as tutorials on how to be better at fe2. I kept on playing, dreaming of meeting you one day, yet that dream has yet to fathom. In any aspect I admire you, and I respect your personal life. I don't want you to feel guilt for deleting this server. Life moves on, we mature, we grow, we lose, we gain. I still remember watching that video of you beating fe2 maps without pressing any buttons and I was inspired to try and do the same. Thank you gentle.

                                 I joined discord without any friends except Uncom, and then I came here. The reason I came to this server is because I was looking for a place that I belonged, but that wasn't here. If I'm being honest I don't think I ever really liked it here, and I never watched a single one of gentles videos. But if you are reading this, I want to thank you for making this server because without it I wouldn't have met a lot of the friends I have today. I can't say I'll miss this place because I won't. I have a lot of memories here I'd rather forget. But thanks for the good ones too. Goodbye chat

                                 <br/>
                                 Four years ago, i joined this server because i was a fan of yours and Flood Escape 2. Those were the things that throughout the years made me continue using discord. On this server, I experienced good, bad and fun times. I met people that were amazing for the time. I was immature at the time and I could say the same for most of us too. But if you all leave this aside, It's only one of the many things you get to experience as a member because it will not occur again. You can't repeat the past by it's own.
                                 <br/>
                                 By joining this server, I made a great choice that surely did bring me bad times because of how I acted, but i met some great people on the way. People I got to chat, hang out with, thanks to Gentle. Seeing the person who brought me here to meet friends and continue being active on discord hurts, but It's for the good. And I appreciate that.
                                 <br/>
                                 This was the beginning of my journey on Flood Escape 2, the very first server I joined on those days. And although I don't play FE2 anymore, the memories are still there. The memories that no matter if they are good or terrible one year later I realized that. This server caused things that I appreciate a lot.
                                 <br/>
                                 Those people are the ones from what I considered a big community at the time and I couldn't just forget right away.
                                 <br/>
                                 I just want to thank you for everything. You were the person that made me continue playing FE2 and laugh. I was just one young kid that just wanted fun. I did get that purpose. And that's what matters.
                                 <br/>
                                 I met a lot of people here and made friendships, friendships that due to my actions I ruined. I couldn't forget you all. To the ones I hurt in the past because of my actions, many months later I realized that and I'm sorry, although some of you will ignore me, I am now aware of the things I did.
                                 <br/>
                                 And you, gentle, thank you for everything. For a long adventure. For the people I met. Seriously, it was amazing.

                                 The good times of fe2... I could write an essay of 5000 words about it, but I'll keep it short. Once I found this game Flood Escape 2, I immediately fell in love with it. It is an awesome game. I have watched many of your videos Gentle. Now that time is over I guess. Hope you are doing good and one last time: goodbye

                                 i first watched gb's content in 2018
                                 <br/>
                                 ever since watching it ive been a fan and always wanted to make art, so i took the chance to make fanart and also improve my art skills
                                 <br/>
                                 in 2019, me and a few others grouped up together to make a fun little project to celebrate gb's 50k subscriber goal, and it was enjoyable and fun
                                 <br/>
                                 but late 2019, the server fell off for me for a little, and i left
                                 <br/>
                                 soon after, i came back in 2020 as to meet my friends back and just, chill as like a genuine hang out instead of squabble over how much of a fan i am (because i already moved on from that point)
                                 <br/>
                                 it remained the same for me until now, knowing that gb is going to move on from his old life to pursue whatever he wants irl
                                 <br/>
                                 i wish you all, and especially berry man, a very good life in the future

                                 I've been watching your videos since the beginning, and I have loved them so much. Your were my inspiration to begin FE2, and that has turned me into the person I am today. Thanks for having me in one of your videos, and I respect your decision as much as anybody. Take care, and maybe we'll see again someday.

                                 this is honestly the nicest server I ever joined, so many friends here and overall a great time. I might have joined late but this year here might was so much fun. the server realm, gamenights, everything. I'll miss it.

                                 So uh I joined kinda late as well, but met some awesome people, and have made a lot of memories here, I remember the strange conversations I had with jojo, and Doruk helping me in JToH, now more than a year later, sweating my ass off with studies (and enjoying the hell out of it somehow), I can say this was a cool server, and seeing as I've already kind of moved on myself, I can feel what it's like to abandon what you had been used to for years and start fresh, and it doesn't disappoint

                                 So to start off, I wasn't the most active in this server, but Gentle's youtube meant a lot to me and all of his viewers. his videos have entertained people countless times, even when i was feeling down, a gentleberry video was something i watched, and it did for sure feel nice to watch. 
                                 <br/>
                                 There's no words to describe how much you've inspired me, my friends and everyone around you. One of my friends has a pretty big youtube channel now (5k) and wouldn't even have made a vid without seeing you. 
                                 <br/>
                                 I remember playing sunken citadel with you was an honour. 
                                 <br/>
                                 Even watching you beat jtoh towers, i enjoyed watching you progress. I really wish we got to see you do a first extreme, but it is what it is. 
                                 <br/>
                                 Thank you, for all you've done

                                 as long as fe2 lives, so does your legacy. You will not be forgotten for a long long time, gentleberry.

                                 Now, it is unfortunate i have to say this and i really wish i didn't have to.

                                 Back in 2018, it's the time when I first became active on discord and more active in 2019 and later.
                                 <br/>
                                 I've heard of gb's content and joined this server by my old friend.
                                 <br/>
                                 and I enjoyed your content, gb :) I remember when I was very excited when I was going to be part of your fe2 videos.
                                 <br/>
                                 This is one of the server that I start to interact with the community and make friends.
                                 <br/>
                                 It was a blast in 2019. This is one of the main factor that I started to make more art using the art channel. And pursuing to improve my art skills by the supports of this community.
                                 <br/>
                                 I remember how I acted back then. Sometimes it was poor and sometimes it was good. Just because I was less mature than today.
                                 <br/>
                                 I also remember how I acted when I got moderator role and artist / creatives role. It was my big milestone back then (It's cringe to think about it for my modern self)
                                 <br/>
                                 I'm glad that I could contribute this server by ensuring this server's moderation.

                                 Until in 2020 and later, I started to being inactive in this server.
                                 <br/>
                                 I remember what I did in the early 2020. It was a poor decision and it was a bitter memories.
                                 <br/>
                                 Having a more comfortable on other server is one of the main reasons that I started to become inactive in this server.
                                 <br/>
                                 Slowly from admin to moderator to former staff.
                                 <br/>
                                 It was the time that I moved on after my decision that I wanted to retire.
                                 <br/>
                                 Discovering new things and trying new things and using what I experienced in this server as a lesson.
                                 <br/>
                                 Moving on is a great decision if you want to try new things and pursue what you really want to be.
                                 <br/>
                                 I'm sorry for the ones I hurt in the past because of my poor actions and my poor decisions.
                                 <br/>
                                 I respect your decision, Gentle. I'm happy that you decided to change the way of your life and pursue what you really want to be.
                                 <br/>
                                 I wish a good future for you.
                                 <br/>
                                 Thank you for everything, Gentle.

                                 well, even though i guess i wasn't as active in this server as a ton of other people in here i guess i do have something to say
                                 <br/>
                                 man this really hurt to see this server completely gone, i remember when i used to watch a lot of gentleberry content (as well as boonmoons) like a couple years ago and joining both servers, but this specific one is the one that i decided to sort of stay in until this very very day (very good content btw such a shame to see it gone)
                                 <br/>
                                 from watching content to being in one video (albeit a minor appearance), you could say it was a sort of dream come true for the average gentleberry fan back then
                                 <br/>
                                 although not many, ill cherish the good times i had in this server, as well as the friends i made here, and thank you for killing my boredom at times while watching youtube haha

                                 I remember when I first joined this server back in 2020, when I was still active in the fe2 community, and this server was where I talked the most.
                                 <br/>
                                 I'm gonna really miss these days, gentle was a really fun youtuber to watch, a bless in disguise, he made mine and many people's days, he was even a super cool person to talk to, I've always joined events from crazyblox and joined one where I saw him. I dont know how he recognised me but he did. That was super terrifying in a nice way haha.
                                 <br/>
                                 Thank you Gentle, you will never be forgotten in this community. Good luck in your future and we hope to see you again somewhere in the future. May your journeys be one of the best.

                                 Gentle is one of my best FE2 YouTuber that ever exist. He makes some good stuff, funnies, and useful content that help me to try. He's also known as a brave and humanity person to make his content until dawn. I remembered that he started follows me during his live stream few years ago and I'm happily to see that. So, when I was inactive for almost a year, I still keep watch his video for entertainment and enjoyable although I was busy at my online school that time. When I first time to join this server, I feel like somethings weird and not ok but this keep me so satisfied and enjoyable. I can say this is the good server that I joined before I joined another servers like Boon's Backyard and Lilltea1's Official Server. When he announced to farewell this server and even his social media, I was shocked to hear that and this server will be disbanded. Although I'm sad about that, but this feel won't lose my fun of Gentle_Berry stuff. So, I hope @Gentle Berry will be a good person in irl stuff and let he will be blessed by god. Thank you always for being a good person with me for 5 years and I'll hope your future will be great and even you success!

                                 Hey there, this user had many names. Some of you might know me as "3 letters and an underscore" username FE2 'YouTuber', or either someone named Revizu and/or Pyrotenix if you have seen Gentle's content back then.
                                 <br/>
                                 Gentle was one of those FE2 YouTubers that I watched before, and he was also one of those FE2 YouTubers that inspired me to create FE2 related content as well. I watched and have liked a lot of his content, those including the comedy videos and informative runs of some maps in both FE2 main game and map testing that he used to make. They were a blast for me.
                                 <br/>
                                 He also has been a part of that 'source of motivation' for me when I got into motion design, and I'm glad that he noticed me and used that work of mine that I could only do back then, which is the introduction. 
                                 <br/>
                                 I'm not even that surprised anymore when most of the FE2/Tower YouTubers that I know of have left over the years, including myself. And those decisions they make, I do respect that, including Gentle's, since I felt the same way too. I (wanted to) forget who I was before and move on to the things that I really loved doing, for us to be much, much better. We'll be seeing what will be ahead of us, as time passes.
                                 <br/>
                                 One final thing, I wish you all the best, for the future of Gentle Berry, and all of the people here in the community, myself included. Thank you, and farewell.

                                 I just wanna say that Gentle really meant a lot for me. He was one of my biggest inspirations. I remember just finding his FE2 content around early 2018 and enjoying it and being inspired by it. He was one of my biggest inspirations for making FE2 content on YouTube. He's also the one that made me more confident in making more fanart for people in general when he responded to my fan art for him, and even made it the server icon one time.
                                 <br/>
                                 I'll be honest when I say that I only made this Discord account just to join Gentle's old Discord server which is now gone I believe due to his past account getting hacked and unable to moderate the server further, so he had to make this one. Even after I lost interest in FE2, I still stayed in this server because this server meant a lot to me. I had made so many memories here, even if it's bad or good. 
                                 <br/>
                                 Thank you everyone, and especially Gentle, for having this amazing community. I have been in this server for 4 years now. (2018 - 2022)  I'd be lying if I said that nothing about this has changed me one bit
                                 <br/>
                                 I'll miss this server as again, I had made lots and lots of memories in here. I'll be sad to see it go but deleting it is for the best, I respect all of Gentle's wishes. Good luck with your journey, Gentle! :)

                                 i dont want to say goodbye but thank you for everything, to everyone. i did honestly grow up here and matured during my 4 years here. i remember being anxious at first when i became mod to do a good job and a lot of conversation i had so thank you to everyone for allowing this opportunity. I started watching gentle probably in 2018 and then found out he had a discord so i joined it. never in a million years would i think that i would see this server deleted and take care everyone

                                 I joined this server in early 2019. This was the second server I've ever joined ever since I started discord, the first being the official fe2 server. I have to say, I had a lot of really great memories here. Even though it was usually kinda quiet, I like how peaceful everyone is to one another, and that made my experience in this server more enjoyable than the rest of the servers I had joined. Ever since I joined this server, whenever I open discord, this would always be the first server I always visit. But now, I can't believe that this server will be gone forever.

                                 Thank you so much for the great memories. You all have pretty much made me part of who I am now. I'll never forget this server cuz it's pretty much engraved in my heart.

                                 Hey Gentleberry,
                                 <br/>
                                 Thank you for inspiring so many people. You're the reason where I am today and I am happy you're doing what you wanna do. Moving on is hard, but if you really set your mind to it, you can accomplish anything. Distractions may be hard to ignore, but you can be anything.
                                 <br/>
                                 Again, thank you for making the influential video on Dense Swamp. I wouldn't be where I am now without the change you made in my life.
                                 <br/>

                                 Okay so I don't know if the server is actually being deleted FR FR‚Ä¶.but IG I'll drop some last goodbyes too while I'm here bc I def had some sort of presence in this server especially around 2018-2019. This might get real lol and very stupid sounding btw. Alright it was in summer 2018 when I first joined this server & it was a time where I was undergoing a bunch of transitioning in terms of drifting away from relationships that meant a lot to me & also starting high school in fall of that year. Looking back, my 14 year old self really didn't know how any better when it came to handling emotions, so the second half of that year was extremely rough for my mental health. I found solace in talking with the people on here & made some memories that I'm still pretty fond of to this day. It's a shame that they've all been wiped & only exist in my memory now. (TBH I get if I wasn't your favorite to talk to bc looking back at some of my messages that I screenshot before the server got wiped, I sounded pretty annoying lmao.) It's honestly kinda silly-sounding how much comfort I found with people I've only ever met online back then, but I guess I can't really blame my past self for doing so during hard times. Obviously, I started to become one of those in-and-out type of people in the server by around 2020, but still‚Äîit's was great to see how some of y'all's were doing every now and then. There are so many things I wanna say & it's difficult to perfectly articulate how much the server meant to me before, AND EVEN NOW TBH haha‚Ä¶but ig I'll end my good bye message with some memories that stick out to me‚Ä¶some that whoever is reading might remember too:
